# USC-REU-Program-Submission

The two submitted code files are examples of my programming in JAVA and R languages. The Java examples is representative of my exploration into high level data structures including binary heaps, KD Trees and Spatial Graphs. The R example is an exploration into the different kind of regression to model sets of data which was inspired by my work in regression within my math classes as well as my interest in R as statistical language that is essential for research. I have also supplied the file that I used to hold data for the R file so if you want to see the program run all you have to do is change the dat entries to point to wherever you place the file on your machine.

The writing assignment was not something I submitted to a class but was inspired by a recent conversation I had with the professor I TA for in the Mathematics of Cybersecurity. We were speaking about different issues with security, prompted by the recent issues with the trails Google is currently undergoing. We both have very different views on what level of security should be permissible within the government ranks and what we as citizens should be guaranteed. As a result, I choose to write my paper on a similar instance, namely the controversy with Apple vs. FBI in 2016. The paper is meant to give an outline of the trial and then seeks to answer why it is so hard to determine what place privacy should take in our society.

Thank you for the opportunity and taking the time to look at my code and paper, I look forward to hearing from you soon!
